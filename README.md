### Hi there.............

I'm terminite, a fish trying to learn more about coding.

- I'm currently working on my discord bot (kou-discord-bot)
- I'm currently learning **Javascript**, **C#**, **C++**, **Lua**, **Assembly x86**
- You can get in reach with me on my discord: `terminite`
- Pronouns: he/him (i joke a lot and say fi/sh)
- Fun fact: lua is boring.....

<!--
